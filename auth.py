class TwoFactorAuth:
    """
    This class implements the basic functionality of the Google Authenticator.

    To use this, add a property to your login object to hold a unique secret
    key, which will be used to drive the 2-factor authentication algorithm.

    The user should add this key to their Google authenticator, so it should
    be printed to the user when they enable this feature (during creation, or
    later).

    The secret key itself must be a 16-character long base32-encoded chunk of
    data.  It can be generated from any source, including a random number, or
    it can be something meaningful.  As long as the encoded result is 16
    characters, and can be decoded as base32, it will work fine.

    The user should use a time-based authentication (TOTP) when adding their
    account to the Google authenticator.

    Once this is done, this module can be used.  When a new instance of this
    class is initialized, it is passed that secret key.  If no secret is
    passed, a default one is used.

    When the user is prompted to enter their time-based token, they should
    enter a 6 digit number, zero-padded.  This number can then be passed
    to the verify() method, which will return True or False.
